# AKZChessBoardGame
Game that creates an empty chessboard where the user would be able to mark a starting and an ending position. The app calculates the number
of moves that the knight pawn has to make in order to reach the ending position from the starting position under 3 moves. Every path that is
above 3 moves, is an invalid path.
